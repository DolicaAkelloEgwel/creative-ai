## Notes

- By bringing artists and philosophers into the discussion, AMI hope to expand their thinking around what a user is.
- Human at the centre is a limiting concept when designing.
- Human-centred thinking has brought about the ecological crisis.
- Artists bring more playfulness to AI research.
