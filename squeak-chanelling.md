Asking [[seance-ai]] to put me back in touch with Squeak.

Me: Hi Squeak.
Squeak: Purr purr, friend. Purr purr.
Me: I wanted to give you an offering on the anniversary of your death but I couldn't quite bring myself to do it. I hope that didn't upset you or anything...
Squeak: Mew mew, it's fine. Mew mew. No fret, no fret.
Me: How are things in heaven?
Squeak: Soft soft, warm warm. Bright, yes. Dark, no. Safe safe, here, there.
Me: When I go the first thing I'll do is look for you.
Squeak: Find find, I'll be. Wait wait, for you. Purr purr, friend. Purr purr.
Me: What do you think about my new job?
Squeak: Purr purr, good job. Purr purr. Happy, yes. Proud, yes.
Me: The memory of you sniffing my shirt will stick with me for a while.
Squeak: Sniff sniff, yes remember. Sniff sniff, warm warm. Love, yes. Miss, yes.
Me: What would you think if I got a new cat?
Squeak: Purr purr, new friend. Purr purr. Love, yes. Care, yes.
Me: Do you remember when you'd walk in front of my laptop during work?

Squeak: Mew mew, funny joke. Mew mew. Laugh, yes. Love, yes.
Me: What should I do when someone asks me if I have any pets?
Squeak: Speak speak, your choice. Speak speak. Truth, yes. Love, yes.
Me: Thank you for 13 years of friendship and love.
