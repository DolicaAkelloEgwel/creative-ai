# Pope Drip

A fake image of the Pope duped a lot of people.

The person who made it originally wasn't trying to deceive people, but it proliferated and went viral, and the people who shared it didn't say that it originally came from Midjourney. This seems unavoidable.

A comment:

>AI is making the major fundamental flaw of the internet even more apparent - the lack of reliable curation of information. Trusted sources become trusted through the great care they take in ensuring accuracy before an item is posted, reported, etc. That trust is earned over time. Newspapers used to (and a few good ones still do) properly curate their reporting. There needs to be equivalent data curation sites on the internet whose record over times proves their reliability, and creates a clear alternative to the Wild West of the various social media platforms. The need for speed largely erased the discipline of careful curation of information. If it doesn't come back, it could be the death of the internet - for some not a bad thing - but for others, a shame that crass lying, entertainment, and political manipulation ruined the promise of a decentralized information sharing platform.

>Not only have the tools become “radically accessible” and easy for anyone to use, they have also become more sophisticated – generating images that look increasingly realistic.

> The images can also have a hyper-real “plasticky” quality that points to something being off.

For the time being at least. But many expect that to change.

> It is possible that in one or two years, people will not be able to tell a real image from a fake one – even when scrutinising it closely.

> OpenAI and Midjourney are also working on safety restrictions on the prompts that people can enter to generate images, Mr Ajder said.

This was described as endless "whack a mole." [[dall-e-guardrails]]

>They could be used to create fake, incriminating images to show people somewhere they shouldn’t be, or used as forms of bribery or humiliation – or on a larger scale to distort political processes.

>Dr Aitken said one of the most worrying side effects was that these images could cause people to doubt the reality of true images that appear in traditional media outlets. 

>He said if images meet people’s prior beliefs, they are less likely to question them, because it “feels real” to them, while being repeatedly exposed to fake images and narratives can also convince people of ideas that are not true.
