# CULTUS

Exhibit by [[zach-blas]]. Comprised of four AI Gods. Some ideas also from John Dee, sigils, and Metatron's Cube.

Partly inspired by [[way-of-the-future]] and [[erik-davis]]. Related to [[technomancy]].

Apparently brain juice was used. How did they get this out?

> The first is **Expositio**, the AI god of desire and digital exposure that seduces and pushes us to voluntarily use AI systems. By doing so, it manages to extract our personal information by exploiting the trust we have in technology and craves our addiction.

> The second is **Iudicium**, the AI god of automation and judgement. It is a ruthless arbiter that subjects humanity to constant evaluation and automated analysis. Only those who appear worthy are granted dematerialization and transformation into data, all the others are reabsorbed into its infinite system of scrutiny loops.

> **Eternus** is the AI god whose goal is to stop aging and death. Its way of acting changes depending on the economic status of the audience. It moves from the more radical projects of life extension and the search for immortality, which are very popular among the ultra-rich people in Silicon Valley (e.g., removal of old cells or young blood transfusions), to the use of anti-aging skin care regimens and nootropic medications. Few are the chosen ones who are encouraged to renounce their flesh and merge into a data-driven superconsciousness in order to reach the so-called singularity. This concept, which foresees a time in the future when humans and artificial intelligence will merge, has fascinated the minds of futurists, philosophers, and technologists for a long time.

> The fourth and last deity is **Lacrimae**. To create a quantification language, the god feeds on human tears, which are extracted through emotion recognition software, as well as on the laborious work required to improve the AI systems.

> Technically sophisticated, CULTUS is based on motion-capture, machine learning, and computer graphics. To create the texts, the AI models were trained on a dataset made up of sadomasochistic erotica, tech mogul TED talks, tech corporation mission statements, transhumanist philosophy, apocalyptic science fiction, and much more. The voices of the prophets were synthesized with the output trained on recordings of weeping, Gregorian chants, the voice of the controversial billionaire Peter Thiel, as well as of ASMR leather rubbing. The AI gods, for their part, seduce and want to be worshiped. With their hypnotic and disturbing forms, they seem to reveal all their voracity and desire to consume the humankind from a psycho-physical and emotional point of view.
