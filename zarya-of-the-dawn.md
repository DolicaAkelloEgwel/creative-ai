## Claude AI Summary

The document is a letter from lawyer Van Lindberg responding to a previous letter from the U.S. Copyright Office regarding the registration of a comic book titled "Zarya of the Dawn." 

- Kristina Kashtanova is the author of the comic book. She used an AI image generation tool called Midjourney as part of her creative process.

- The Copyright Office initiated cancellation of the registration because it was unclear if the work had sufficient human authorship since AI was used. 

- Lindberg argues that Kashtanova authored every aspect of the work, with Midjourney merely assisting. He details Kashtanova's extensive creative process in writing the story and guiding Midjourney to generate images matching her vision.

- At minimum, Lindberg argues the text is authored by Kashtanova and the work represents a copyrightable compilation due to her creative selection and arrangement of text and AI-generated images.

- Lindberg acknowledges the individual AI-generated images themselves likely don't qualify for copyright protection. However, Kashtanova's edits to some images in Photoshop may contain protectable authorship. 

- Lindberg asks the Copyright Office to affirm its prior registration of the work to Kashtanova, excluding only the individual AI-generated images themselves.

In summary, Lindberg makes a case that Kashtanova had sufficient creative involvement as author of the comic book even though she used AI technology, and therefore it should maintain copyright registration.
