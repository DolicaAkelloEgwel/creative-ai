Paper comparing GPT literature and human literature.
## Abstract

Using artificial intelligence (AI)-authored texts as a baseline for reading literary originals can help us discern what is new about today’s literature, rather than relying on the AI itself to embody that newness. GPT-3 is a language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. Its writing is (in)credible at first sight, but, like dreams, quickly becomes boring, nonsensical, or both. Engineers suggest this shortcoming indicates a complexity issue, but it also reveals an aspect of literary innovation: how stylistic tendencies are extended to disrupt normative reading habits in ways that are analogous to the disruptive experience our present and emergent reality.

There is a dark irony to GPT-3’s inability to write coherently into the future: large language models are exploitative and wasteful technologies accessible only to multi-million-pound corporations. The commercial ambitions of the tool are evident in a curiously banal kind of writing, entirely symptomatic of the corporate-engineered sense of normalcy that obscures successive, irreversible crises as we sleep walk through the glitch era. Contrary to this, experimental literary practices can provoke critical-sensory engagement with the difficulties of our time.

I propose that GPT-3 can be a measure of what effective literary difficulty is. I test this using two recent works, The Employees, a novel by Olga Ravn, and the ‘Septology’ series of novels by Jon Fosse. I contrast their ‘experiential literature’ with blankly convincing machine-authored versions of their work.
## Claude AI Summary

The document is an academic article that compares AI-generated text from GPT-3 to experimental literature by human authors. The key points are:

- GPT-3 can produce convincing text at the sentence and phrase level, but longer passages often become incoherent or nonsensical. This reveals a key aspect of literary innovation - how stylistic tendencies are extended to disrupt normative reading habits.

- GPT-3 reflects a commercial culture that produces banal, corporate-engineered writing. Experimental literature can provoke critical engagement with contemporary difficulties. 

- The author proposes using GPT-3 as a baseline to measure the effectiveness of literary "difficulty" in two recent works - The Employees by Olga Ravn and the Septology novels by Jon Fosse. 

- Human authors like Ravn and Fosse use error and difficulty in innovative ways to connect the reader to the experience of social transformation. GPT-3 enumerates quantitatively on what already exists in language, while experimental literature develops qualitatively.

- Comparing GPT-3 and human-written passages reveals how Ravn and Fosse extend concepts in literature to challenge the reader. GPT-3 repeats existing tropes, while they subvert expectations.

- The "glitches" made by human authors form new connections between writer, language and reader, allowing new ways of thinking. GPT-3 cannot match this type of conceptual innovation.
