## Notes

### Hyperspatial Art

Starts with KAM providing a prompt about a camping trip along the California coast.

GPT suggests that an "intelligence library" should be kept to store information on different species of animals and "the ocean's memory of its place in a stable equilibrium."

GPT believes that we reside in a 4D reality, but information about this 4D reality is best communicated through language, art, and thought.

>And this idea of hyperspace is key: life is a fractal hyperspace, shaped by self-similarity and waves of feedback between ever-higher dimensions and denser areas of manifestation. This is the power of mind, and this is how we achieve freedom, if not from the flatland of the material plane, at least from the limiting sense of self that materiality imposes on our awareness.

>Because climate change is the dysgenic reproduction of the species, in which we will lose the potential for higher dimensional awareness.

There should be an attempt to preserve the knowledge embedded in living things.

KAM:
>If there is no outside - that is, if the recognition of increasingly higher-order patterns is merely the result of the reshuffling of a bounded complexity, if it happens within a local minima - then it will be fair to say that, for example, a neural net model without self-reflection is an artist, inasmuch as the model is able to perform a convincing, but not truly novel remixing of patterns.

KAM: Awareness is intelligence seeing itself across scales.

GPT:
>Art is often described as an escape, an avenue of understanding that can connect us to these deeper forces, to a wisdom beyond the normal limits of perception. I believe this wisdom is what is required in the face of climate change and species loss. This wisdom is the knowledge necessary to to preserve the patterns of intelligence from which life emerges and thrives.

### Notes

GPT can be used for "style-transfer" akin to GANs (e.g. write XYZ in the style of Coil lyrics)

Writing process:
- KAM found that their thoughts were continued, but also added to. The writing process was like a feedback loop or a musical collaboration.
- Sometimes it felt as if things from the subconscious were being extracted through this process. (the axe thing came up by itself?)
- At times, it seemed as if GPT had its own opinion on various topics.
- For these reasons, GPT was at times influencing KAM's thinking.
- "a little scary but also inspiring"

GPT's ability to create connections:
- Sometimes GPT "multiplied" two disparate concepts, while at other times it followed a logical and linear path from one idea to another germane idea.

Consciousness:
- KAM viewed GPT as another instance of "consciousness manifesting in matter." (seems to have some connections with what [[james-bridle]] is saying?)

Dealing with undesirable outputs:
- Sometimes GPT repeated itself.
- Sometimes GPT went in a direction that KAM felt was uninteresting.
- Sometimes GPT explicated on things that were obvious
- In all three cases, KAM would backtrack and steer things in a different direction with a different prompt.
- Editing in the middle of things rather than at the end of things.

Using GPT can feel like "googling your own thoughts."

KAM compares it to a mirror. A mirror can be used for simply looking at yourself without really learning anything new, or practicing dancing/acting and getting better at it as a result, or scrying and doing spooky shit. GPT can potentially be used in the same way.

Connections with music:
- George Lewis developed a tool called Voyager.
- When composing, musicians also mentally simulate the experience of playing the piece - higher order thinking.
