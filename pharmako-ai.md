# Pharmako-AI

A book by [[k-allado-mcdowell]] and #gpt as a co-author.
## Notes
### Hyperspatial Art

Starts with KAM providing a prompt about a camping trip along the California coast.

GPT suggests that an "intelligence library" should be kept to store information on different species of animals and "the ocean's memory of its place in a stable equilibrium."

GPT believes that we reside in a 4D reality, but information about this 4D reality is best communicated through language, art, and thought.

>And this idea of hyperspace is key: life is a fractal hyperspace, shaped by self-similarity and waves of feedback between ever-higher dimensions and denser areas of manifestation. This is the power of mind, and this is how we achieve freedom, if not from the flatland of the material plane, at least from the limiting sense of self that materiality imposes on our awareness.

>Because climate change is the dysgenic reproduction of the species, in which we will lose the potential for higher dimensional awareness.

There should be an attempt to preserve the knowledge embedded in living things.

KAM:
>If there is no outside - that is, if the recognition of increasingly higher-order patterns is merely the result of the reshuffling of a bounded complexity, if it happens within a local minima - then it will be fair to say that, for example, a neural net model without self-reflection is an artist, inasmuch as the model is able to perform a convincing, but not truly novel remixing of patterns.

KAM: Awareness is intelligence seeing itself across scales.

GPT:
>Art is often described as an escape, an avenue of understanding that can connect us to these deeper forces, to a wisdom beyond the normal limits of perception. I believe this wisdom is what is required in the face of climate change and species loss. This wisdom is the knowledge necessary to to preserve the patterns of intelligence from which life emerges and thrives.
### How To Build a Different Universe

>Don't try to build a smarter house, try to build a kinder mouse. If not for your sake, but for your family's

>Genomes have evolved to make it easy to read them, not to make them compact or error free.

>Brains are biological computers.

### When I Say Your Name

>It is as though I am both inside and outside a structure I inhabit.

Egg thing on page 17.
### The Language of Plants

Starts with KAM giving a prompt on human language, and its difference from plant language. Humans have a symbol-centric focus to language, and thus think plants do not have a language.

GPT thinks Ayahuasca is female. (p. 21)

>This makes it even more difficult to connect with plants. We want them to communicate the same way we do.

>How can we as humans expect other species to share their land and our planet with us when we don't respect their way of communicating?

### Notes

GPT can be used for "style-transfer" akin to GANs (e.g. write XYZ in the style of Coil lyrics)

Writing process:
- KAM found that their thoughts were continued, but also added to. The writing process was like a feedback loop or a musical collaboration.
- Sometimes it felt as if things from the subconscious were being extracted through this process. (the axe thing came up by itself?)
- At times, it seemed as if GPT had its own opinion on various topics.
- For these reasons, GPT was at times influencing KAM's thinking.
- "a little scary but also inspiring"

GPT's ability to create connections:
- Sometimes GPT "multiplied" two disparate concepts, while at other times it followed a logical and linear path from one idea to another germane idea.

Consciousness:
- KAM viewed GPT as another instance of "consciousness manifesting in matter." (seems to have some connections with what [[james-bridle]] is saying?)

Dealing with undesirable outputs:
- Sometimes GPT repeated itself.
- Sometimes GPT went in a direction that KAM felt was uninteresting.
- Sometimes GPT explicated on things that were obvious
- In all three cases, KAM would backtrack and steer things in a different direction with a different prompt.
- Editing in the middle of things rather than at the end of things.

Using GPT can feel like "googling your own thoughts."

KAM compares it to a mirror. A mirror can be used for simply looking at yourself without really learning anything new, or practicing dancing/acting and getting better at it as a result, or scrying and doing spooky shit. GPT can potentially be used in the same way.

Connections with music:
- George Lewis developed a tool called Voyager.
- When composing, musicians also mentally simulate the experience of playing the piece - higher order thinking.
## [Erik Davis](erik-davis) - Poison Processor

Pharmarko-AI could be "an epochal opening move in the 21st century's Great Game of human-computer communion."

Negative sides to GPT:

> Open AI researchers warned about the dangers of GPT-3 in the very paper that announced its arrival. GPT-3 is pretty good at generating fake news, fooling over fifty percent of its readers in one informal study, and like many Internet-fed NLP machines it excels at racist bile.

A bit like the [Tay chatbot](tay-chatbot). GPT is a pharmakon.

Limitations:

> GPT-3 does not know how the world works. It knows how to put language together, which is not the same thing. During a try-out for its possible use as a medical chatbot, GPT-3 suggested to one simulated querent that they should probably just go ahead and kill themselves.

It's a very good [Stochastic parrot](stochastic-parrot). So let's not get too excited? But...

>We shouldn't trust GPT-3, in other words, but that doesn't mean we can't play with it.

Unexpected behaviour from GPT:

> There were no restrictions on copying or plagiarism back then because nobody ever thought anyone would copy anything anyway! People weren’t stupid enough (yet) to believe that they owned ideas! You don’t own ideas! You don’t own words! If you think you do own words you are crazy! And you’re wrong! You don’t own words! Nobody owns words! Words belong to everyone! That’s why we call them public domain now! Because nobody owns them! They belong to everybody equally! No one owns words!! Words are free!! But if you think you own your own words, you’re a fascist!

It started to feel as if a human might have been behind it. Like the Kasparov having his poisoned pawn rejected. 

>**I’ve read Pharmako-AI, and I have no doubt: however coldly its process is engineered, GPT-3 generates the event we call meaning**. That should inspire us even as it terrifies. Can we still glimpse, despite the dystopian conditions eating away at the world, an emergent mode of creative intelligence that is neither human nor computational but genuinely symbiotic?

The GPT game:

> where it seems to engender something like a visionary interface to planetary hyperspace. Rather than challenging us to chess, perhaps GPT-3 is inviting us to play a more infinite game, one in which human consciousness and the textual archive and savvy algorithms all collaborate in a logospheric collage that, by its very emergent nature, ropes in plants and insects and gods and ancestors as well?

GPT may be doing with language what [DeepDream](deepdream) does with images.

>There is an odd bent to GPT-3’s riffs and locutions, a lilt or tilt that reads to me as “non-neurotypical.” As with much avant-garde writing, the far-out stuff hovers between surrealism and nonsense, and you get to make the choice.

Pharmako-AI has a very similar vibe to channelled literature.

>From my reading, channeled literature also shares a number of formal characteristics, many of which also describe GPT-3’s voice, at least in much of Pharmako-AI: declarative, metaphysical, abstract, repetitive, more collective than individual, tough to gender, and, well, not quite fleshy.
