### Notes

GPT can be used for "style-transfer" akin to GANs (e.g. write XYZ in the style of Coil lyrics)

Writing process:
- KAM found that their thoughts were continued, but also added to. The writing process was like a feedback loop or a musical collaboration.
- Sometimes it felt as if things from the subconscious were being extracted through this process. (the axe thing came up by itself?)
- At times, it seemed as if GPT had its own opinion on various topics.
- For these reasons, GPT was at times influencing KAM's thinking.
- "a little scary but also inspiring"

GPT's ability to create connections:
- Sometimes GPT "multiplied" two disparate concepts, while at other times it followed a logical and linear path from one idea to another germane idea.

Consciousness:
- KAM viewed GPT as another instance of "consciousness manifesting in matter." (seems to have some connections with what [[james-bridle]] is saying?)

Dealing with undesirable outputs:
- Sometimes GPT repeated itself.
- Sometimes GPT went in a direction that KAM felt was uninteresting.
- Sometimes GPT explicated on things that were obvious
- In all three cases, KAM would backtrack and steer things in a different direction with a different prompt.
- Editing in the middle of things rather than at the end of things.

Using GPT can feel like "googling your own thoughts."

KAM compares it to a mirror. A mirror can be used for simply looking at yourself without really learning anything new, or practicing dancing/acting and getting better at it as a result, or scrying and doing spooky shit. GPT can potentially be used in the same way.

Connections with music:
- George Lewis developed a tool called Voyager.
- When composing, musicians also mentally simulate the experience of playing the piece - higher order thinking.
