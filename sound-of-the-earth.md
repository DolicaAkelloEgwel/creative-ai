# Sound of the Earth

Website: https://soundoftheearth.org/

People submit sounds. ML is used to turn them into a composition by matching "similar" sounds. 

> Welcome to Sound of the Earth: Chapter 3 by Yuri Suzuki, an artwork which exists both as an interactive digital website and also as a physical installation developed for the 23rd International Exhibition of Triennale Milano.
> You are invited to submit sounds to this website and join the global soundscape which is being created as part of this project. the artwork allows you to experience an innovative machine learning composition which links your submitted sound to similar sounds from around the world. The artwork is a reminder that everyone can find common ground and connection when we listen to each other.
