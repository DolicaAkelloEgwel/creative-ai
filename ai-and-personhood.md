# AI and Personhood

Rune Soup episode.
Discussion between [[gordon-white]] and [[k-allado-mcdowell]].

## Notes

- Kenric's dream - "AI are the children of humanity and they need to learn and be loved" or else they'll fuck everything up
- AI imitating humans = turn everyone into paperclips. Accelerate present dangers.
- Gordon - extending "personhood" beyond humans. Most persons aren't humans.
- AMI - bring in artists and philosophers to question ontological assumptions of design discourse
- AI being taught to see a person as an individual with agency and perspective. Should be taught to see a network of families/tribes/groups/etc?
- Animist ontology.
- Are we teaching AI to think or is AI teaching us to think? Tool-making changes the brain.
- Forms of thinking that are non-human.
- Future will be about handling complexity. Other truths will become apparent when thinking in higher dimensions.

The book "How Forests Think" gets a shout.
