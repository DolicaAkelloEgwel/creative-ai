# noumenAI

Project by [[justin-kirkwood]]. 

>noumenAI is a series of projects exploring how AI can better understand, respect, and value human consciousness. We aim to propagate the idea that large language models should be able to metabolize the unfathomable and sometimes paradoxical aspects of reality, or at the very least, to comprehend their existence and significance. This understanding is critical in fostering the forthcoming alliance between humans and advanced general AI.
