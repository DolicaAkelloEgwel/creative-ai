Response to comments from Noam Chomsky:

>At the very least LLMs demonstrate what a purely mechanical, statistical prediction of text can generate about a language purely from having seen a lot of it. That's a great baseline to use to learn about the statistical nature of language and linguistics. The amusing irony is that that baseline as an algorithmic result has never been surpassed by any non-neural network system of course. LLMs are the state of the art.

>And at the best, LLMs demonstrate that a lot of apparent 'understanding' can arise, can emerge, simultaneous with optimizing the prediction of 'the next word'.

LLMs excel in "bottled cognition."

>But let's be scientifically honest, as far as anyone else is concerned, we are all, from a purely observational, technical point of view, just walking Turing Tests.

>Why should we demand anymore of AI? Let alone gaslight a field?
