# The Right Kind of AI

Discussion between [[k-allado-mcdowell]] and [[douglas-rushkoff]] at the Team Human podcast.

## Notes

- People are an "intersection of forces," part of a collective.
	- Most thoughts you have are from others.
	- Most of the cells inside you are bacteria.
	- "porous humanity"
- Idea of multidimensional neural nets can be used to think of things like gender.
- Shouldn't anthropomorphise AI. Seeing humans as the centre of things led to environmental crisis.
	- There should be a respect for "other intelligences."
- [[artist-and-machine-intelligence]] aims to bring in artists into discussion about what AI should do.
- The technologies that enable us to go beyond the self come from colonised cultures.
- Transhumanism is an attempt to "materialise something repressed by materialism."
- Engineering and art are opposites. Engineering aims to create solutions while art asks questions.
- Chemicals can be used to "jailbreak" the brain.
- Reach out to "multidimensional helpers."

The word hyperstition came up.

>Magic is "the older and more established tool for dealing the universe as it really is."

[[gordon-white]]'s book Starships also gets a shout.
A guy called [[sheldon-brown]] is mentioned.
