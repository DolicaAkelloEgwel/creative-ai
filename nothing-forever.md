> Nothing, ForeverÂ is a show about nothing, that happens forever. Kinda like popular sitcoms of the past, except that it never stops. Nothing, Forever is always-on, runs 365 days of the year, and delivers new content every minute. Everything you see, hear, or experience (with the exception of the artwork and laugh track) is always brand new content, generated via machine learning and AI algorithms.

Actual quotes from the show:

>But don't you think the mind is like an electric zebra?

>Potatoes are weird. Like they're just sitting there all silent and lumpy. Who agreed to this?
